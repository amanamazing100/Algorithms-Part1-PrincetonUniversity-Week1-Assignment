# Algorithms-Part1-PrincetonUniversity-Week1-Assignment
This is week 1 assignment of Algorithms, part1, princeton university(version-1)

This is C++ version of the assignment. Anyone who finds a flaw or improvement are welcome to suggest.


This is not exhaustive, and has following limitations:
1. No input asked from user for the grid dimensions, though it can be very easily changed in the source code.
2. User can't select which nodes to open, it will be done on a random basis(the number of nodes opened can be controlled in the source code though).
3. The C++ rand() function always generates the same set of numbers, so the function to calculate the average number of nodes required won't really make any sense.

The limitations have been tried to get corrected by:
1. Displaying which nodes were opened, and giving the exact number of nodes opened since rand() would generate the same number multiple times.
2.Also suggesting which nodes are opened again, to get a better track of the nodes.
3. The source code have been highly modulated, so its easy to make global changes.


Periodic and frequent updates would be made by yours sincerely on any bugs or improvements found.
